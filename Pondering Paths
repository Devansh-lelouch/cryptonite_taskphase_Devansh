# Module Introduction
In this module we learn about linux file paths.
A root is the directory of the file , it starts with `/`
We refer to files and directories by there paths.

## The Root 
We are invoking `pwn` program by using its absolute path

Type in `/pwn`
The flag is :
>pwn.college{wZdhrZQtZGJRn1m7CZfx3bxfxvZ.dhzN5QDL4YjN0czW}

## Program with absolute paths

We need to invoke a file which is inside another directory which is in turn
inside another directory. 

`/challenge/run` first goes inside `/` directory and then in `challenge`
and finally accesses the file `run`

The flag is :
>pwn.college{QMHsmYRqCCRTvklTMq4SjlIgK0y.dVDN1QDL4YjN0czW}

## Position thy self
`cd` command is used to change directory
