As we have already saved the commands 
```
/challenge/pwn
/challenge/college 
``` 
in the x.sh file in the previous challenge its already there we just need to confirm the name 
using `ctrl+O` and exit it by ctrl+x . 

We are piping it using `./x.sh | /challenge/solve` 

the flag is : 
>pwn.college{gUlU92i5-5zZbhI2eue6wjs1WXI.dhTM5QDL4YjN0czW}
