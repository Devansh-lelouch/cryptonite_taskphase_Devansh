We can list the currently running process using the ps command 
ps either stands for "process snapshot" or "process status"

Two ways to run it :

"Standard" Syntax: in this syntax, you can use -e to list "every" process and -f for a "full format" output, including arguments. These can be combined into a single argument `-ef`

"BSD" Syntax: in this syntax, you can use a to list processes for all users, x to list processes that aren't running in a terminal, and u for a "user-readable" output. These can be combined into a single argument aux.

Differences between ps aux and ps -ef
`ps -ef` additionally outputs the Parent Process ID (PPID), while ps aux outputs the percentage of total system CPU and Memory that the process is utilizing.

In this we write `ps ef` and run `/challenge/31465-run-189`
