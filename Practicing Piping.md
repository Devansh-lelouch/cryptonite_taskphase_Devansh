# Practicing Piping
Sixth module talking about input output redirection

## Redirecting Output
`>`character is used  to give output in a file 
`echo PWN > COLLEGE` will write PWN in the file COLLEGE
The Flag is :
>pwn.college{A2HQbH1sN1AwJg3mbm_gWqrtq07.dRjN1QDL4YjN0czW}

 ## Redirecting More output
We can redirect commands to a output as well 
`/challenge/run > myflag` will redirect the output of `/challenge/run ` to myflag
printing myflag with `cat myflag` will get you the output (i.e flag ) from `/challenge/run` 

The Flag is 
>pwn.college{4L-jlg03htA5doWdpYXhj7Ur9ES.dVjN1QDL4YjN0czW}
