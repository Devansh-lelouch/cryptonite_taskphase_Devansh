Steps:
Traditional Method Using cat: A typical approach would be to use cat as follows:

```
PWN=$(cat /challenge/read_me)
echo $PWN
```
While this works, itâ€™s considered inefficient for small tasks like reading a file into a variable.

Efficient Method Using read and Input Redirection: Instead of using cat, we can directly use the read command with input redirection to achieve the same result:

```

read PWN < /challenge/read_me && echo $PWN
```
Explanation:
`read PWN < /challenge/read_me` reads the content of /challenge/read_me and stores it in the PWN variable by redirecting the file into the read command.
&& echo $PWN ensures that once the file is read, the content of PWN is echoed immediately, showing the flag.
Why This Works:
The read command normally reads input from standard input (stdin), but by using input redirection (<), we can point read to the file /challenge/read_me. This way, the file content gets stored in the PWN variable without needing to call external utilities like cat.

This method is cleaner and faster, especially when dealing with frequent file reads in a shell environment.
